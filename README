This is a VERY unstable and unfinished version of Echo. It isn't anywhere
ready for use in production code, and it's up here only so other people can
help with development. This also means this git will be a mess until it's
ready for use.

tl;dr DON'T USE ECHO YET :|

Echo tools are available as part of the mdtools set:
https://github.com/sikthehedgehog/mdtools

Also Oerg made a xm2esf tool, and an ESF optimization tool:
https://github.com/oerg866/xm2esf

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Current version: 0.9

   And yes, I know the source code is a mess, I need to clean it up severely.
   Also I know some stuff could be done better (e.g. buffering PCM instead of
   reading each byte from ROM every time), but leaving that for after the
   first official release, don't fix what isn't broken -_-'

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

How to build:

   * Make sure the root of this source code tree is the current directory
   * Assemble src-z80/build.z80 to bin/prog-z80.bin
   * Assemble src-68k/build.68k to bin/prog-68k.bin

   Sorry for not providing a build script but my current setup is a mess and
   needs to be changed x_x; Currently using z80-asm to build the Z80 code and
   asm68k to build the 68000 code, I need to find good replacements for both
   (z80-asm for being crappy, asm68k for not being free).
   
   Also no source for the data blobs yet, for similar reasons, although I
   have more control over those tools at least so I may come up with good
   replacements (or even just rebuild the current tools, pretty sure one of
   them (mdtiler) already has a replacement) :/

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Available builds:

   built/prog-z80.bin
      Current build of Echo.

   built/echo-timer-version-a.bin
      Timer test. Both timers get reloaded each time they're fired.
   built/echo-timer-version-b.bin
      Timer test. Only timer B is reloaded when it fires, timer A is left to
      loop on its own.
   built/echo-timer-version-c.bin
      Timer test. Both timers are left to loop on their own. Code for
      initializing timer B is wrong so it doesn't work properly.
   built/echo-timer-version-d.bin
      What the previous ROM should have been, fixed timer B :|
